# Jellyfin-Media-Bar - Now with Play Now Function

**IMP UPDATE — We have dropped support for the normal CSS version (for now). _(It still works, but there will be no further updates till the fullscreen mode is stabilized)_** 

The fullscreen version has a new look (in beta), and support for different screen sizes has been added. For any visual goof-ups, please open a bug report, including the device being used and whether it is encountered in portrait or landscape mode.


Thanks to the Man, the Legend [BobHasNoSoul](https://github.com/BobHasNoSoul) for his work on the [jellyfinfeatured](https://github.com/BobHasNoSoul/jellyfin-featured) and [SethBacon](https://forum.jellyfin.org/u-sethbacon) and [TedHinklater](https://github.com/tedhinklater) for their take on the [Jellyfin-Featured-Content-Bar](https://github.com/tedhinklater/Jellyfin-Featured-Content-Bar). 

Here I present my version with some code improvements, loading optimizations, and security enhancements. Works best with the [Zombie theme](https://github.com/MakD/zombie-release) (_Shameless Plug_ `@import url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MakD/zombie-release@latest/zombie_revived.css);`, visit the repo for more color schemes).

# Want a Custom List to be showcased instead of random items??

No worries this got you covered. 

## Steps

1. Create a `list.txt` file inside your `avatars` folder.
2. In line 1 give your list a name.
3. Starting line 2, paste the item IDs you want to be showcased, one ID per line. For Example :

```
Awesome Playlist Name
ItemID1
ItemID2
ItemID3
ItemID4
ItemID5
```
The next time it loads, it will display these items.
